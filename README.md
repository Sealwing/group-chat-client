# group-chat-client
Study project of creating a client-server on Java with JavaFX. Only standart Java 8 SE instruments. Will be nice, if it could help someone to clear out something about such basic stuff.
# RUN
Runnable jar file in the target folder or you can assemble project by yourself with maven "clean compile assembly:single".
Soon the server part of group chat will be added.
# USING
After logging in, you could check up groups curently have been run on this server session.
To connect one of them, put group's name into the first field, the password (if it is there) in another and click "join" button.
Creation comes the same way, but using the "create" button.
The screen clears up as you join group, but not when you are leaving one.
As it is quite possible two users to have the same nickname, it is forbidden to have such trick with group names.
# BE ATTENTIVE
For this time user doesn't disconnect on quiting the application.
